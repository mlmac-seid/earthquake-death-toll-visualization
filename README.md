# earthquake-death-toll-visualization
Creates visualizations to answer the questions:\
Is an earthquake's focal depth (depth of hypocenter below Earth's surface) or magnitude more strongly correlated with the number of deaths resulting from that earthquake?\
What is the distribution of the death toll between earthquake magnitude classes (categorical descriptions of an earthquake's magnitude)?\
Does earthquake death toll follow the severity of earthquake magnitude?
